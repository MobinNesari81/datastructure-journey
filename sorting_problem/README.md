## Sorting Problem

Sorting is the process of placing a sequence of data together in some particular order.
This simple job has become an important part of algorithm analysis as it is needed in most applications that we face nowadays.


### Definition:

**Input:** A sequence of numbers < a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> >

**Output:** A permutation (reordering) < a<sup>'</sup><sub>1</sub>, a<sup>'</sup><sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sup>'</sup><sub>n</sub> >
of the input sequence such that a<sup>'</sup><sub>1</sub>  <  a<sup>'</sup><sub>2</sub>  < ...  <  a<sup>'</sup><sub>n</sub>

## Variaty

There are alot of algorithms that solves sorting problem. Some of theme are faster than others when the volume of data grows. Some of theme are faster in small collections. 
Lots of theme don't use extra memory and a few of theme do. Here are the types of algorithms that we studied.

- [Insersion Sort](/insertion_sort)
- [Bubble Sort](/bubble_sort)
- [Merge Sort](/merge_sort)

If you lookup in the web you can find more algorithms to study.

## Purpose
Sorting is a problem that will appear in most situations and this is the reason that we have too many algorithms for it.
But The main reason of solving this problem is to make it easier to find and search elements inside collections.
When you're playing card games, you always want to find a particular card in your hand and of course it's more simple when your cards are sorted in some order that your comfortable.
