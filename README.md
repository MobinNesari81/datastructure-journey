This repo represents all we learned and are learning in Data Structure course which is based on *CLRS* book and is being taught by [Dr. Ali Katanforoush](http://facultymembers.sbu.ac.ir/katanforoush/).

## Algorithms

According to *CLRS*, an algorithm  is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
output.

An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the
input into the output.



## Sorting Problem

Every little task in real life that contains some arranging or keeping some orders has a kind of sorting problem in it. For instance if you're a teacher and you want to have a list of your students in an the order of their grades in exams, you need an algorithm to sort them.
